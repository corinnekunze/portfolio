		<h3><a href="http://planetargon.com/2013/" target="_blank">Planet Argon 2013 Year in Review</a></h3>
		<p class="lgt-margin">I took on the Year in Review project for 2013 for Planet Argon. With some help from the team, I lead development, design, and production for the site. Notable technologies: CSS3 Animations, Javascript and Jquery, Sass, Responsive Development.</p>

		<h3><a href="http://planetargon.com/timeline/">Planet Argon Timeline</a></h3>
		<p class="lgt-margin">A very cool project to tell the whole story of Planet Argon as a company. My role was everything from collecting the information, to design, to all the development. It was a great project to learn from. I was manipulating a large Javascript plugin (<a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/" target="_blank">timeline.js</a>) to behave like I wanted it to. Notable technologes: JSON, Javascript, Git submodules, Sass.</p>

		<h3><a href="http://corinnekunze.github.io/24-hour-time-converter/" target="_blank">24 Hour Time Converter</a></h3>
		<p class="lgt-margin">Javascript is awesome, it's not every day that I get to write a javascript program from scratch. That's exactly what this project was. I wanted to use native javascript without a library to see what I could do. I built a converter that converts time both ways, using REGEX validation and user errors. Also used bootstrap to quickly make add some visual appeal.</p>

		<h3><a href="/" target="_blank">Reworked Portfolio</a></h3>
		<p class="lgt-margin">You're looking at it! My reworked portfolio, although design is more or less the same, I decided I'd like to update my code with the things I've learned, build a site using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, and move away from FTP to use a rack server on Heroku. A lot of the work went into building a responsive site from the ground up and optimizing my CSS for reusable styles.</p>
