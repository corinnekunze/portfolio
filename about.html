title: Corinne Kunze - About Me
---
							<div class="aboutme big-margin pull-left">
								<h3 class="blue-font">Interactive Web Designer and Front-End Developer</h3>
								<p class="big-margin">I am currently living in beautiful Portland, 
								Oregon but I grew up in the Colorado 
								Rocky Mountains. Those mountains have 
								been a big part of shaping who I am.
								<br><br>
								That might explain my love for wide open 
								spaces in design and enjoying simple 
								things in life. I like <span>creating things</span> and <span>solving problems.</span> I see my career as a way to promote and create for companies, artists, and individuals.

								My mission is to constantly learn, contribute, and engage with the world.</p>
								<p class="big-margin small blue-font">23 years old, geek/nerd hybrid, avid biker, and self proclaimed foodie - Corinne has been tinkering with building websites since she was in grade school. </p>
