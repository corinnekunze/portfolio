			<h3 class="blue-font">Interactive Web Designer and Web Developer</h3>
			<p class="big-margin">Currently, I'm living in beautiful Portland, 
			Oregon but I grew up in the Colorado 
			Rocky Mountains.
			<br><br>
			That might explain my love for wide open 
			spaces in design and enjoying simple 
			things in life. I like <span>creating things</span> and <span>solving problems.</span> I see my career as a way to promote and create for companies, artists, and individuals.

			My mission is to constantly learn, contribute, and engage with the world.</p>
